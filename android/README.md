# Android Build Fix for isar_flutter_libs

## Issue
The project was encountering a build error related to the `isar_flutter_libs` package:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':isar_flutter_libs'.
> Could not create an instance of type com.android.build.api.variant.impl.LibraryVariantBuilderImpl.
   > Namespace not specified. Specify a namespace in the module's build file: /home/kronos/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/isar_flutter_libs-3.1.0+1/android/build.gradle.
```

This error occurs because newer versions of the Android Gradle Plugin require a namespace to be specified in the build.gradle file of each module.

## Solution
A script has been created to automatically fix this issue by adding the required namespace to the isar_flutter_libs build.gradle file.

### How to use the fix
1. Make sure the script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x android/fix_isar_flutter_libs.sh
   ```

2. Run the script before building the project:
   ```bash
   ./android/fix_isar_flutter_libs.sh
   ```

3. Build the project as usual.

### What the script does
The script adds the following line to the android block in the isar_flutter_libs build.gradle file:
```gradle
namespace "dev.isar.isar_flutter_libs"
```

This ensures that the package has a properly defined namespace, which is required by the Android Gradle Plugin.

### Note
This is a temporary fix until the package is updated to include the namespace in its build.gradle file. If you update the package, you may need to run the script again.
